# SDAIA_Bootcamp
Project Title: Arabic news classification using NLP

Welcome, everyone! We implemented our project using several models. Unfortunately, We can't upload it to GitHub due to the size of each model. We used an SVM model, LR model, NB model, LSTM model, and Arabert transformer.

Our dataset consists of two datasets available on Kaggle.

That's all for now. Thank you!
